# Determining Equitable COVID-19 Vaccination Site Locations Through Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains all data files and code utilized in my capstone project for the Data Science graduate program at University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

## Project Goal

This project aims to use an unsupervised weighted centroid-based clustering algorithm and neighborhood-level demographic Census data to determine equitable vaccination distribution sites in six counties across five states that were previously identified by NPR as containing the largest vaccination disparity between majority-White communities and majority-BIPOC communities. Results will be displayed on an interactive web app that will allow users to input parameters and compare the vaccination distribution maps.

# Phase 1
Data Collection: 
*   Tabular Census data and spatial boundary data from [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/).
*   Current vaccination sites from health department sites of: Alabama, Louisianna, Texas, Georgia, Maryland.

Data cleaning & wrangling:
*   Data was subsetted to the counties of interest and joined to the spatial boundary shapefiles.
*   

# Phase 2


# Phase 3
